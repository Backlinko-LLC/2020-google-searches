------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2 Setup

In most instances, we provide a data set for you to analyze. We¬¥ll provide context, share a short overview of the data by sending you a loom video, and discuss what type of research questions/cool angles might be worth exploring.

Once everything is clear on what needs to be done, we¬¥ll get started with the analysis.

## R Project Analysis Template - Full (Master)

This template is meant to guide and structure your analysis projects in R. Delete the contents of this readme and fill it out again with your actual project readme. Guide for [markdown formatted text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

The folder structure helps to organize data and scripts according to their purpose and facilitate easy reuse of project work flows on new data sets. Feel free to delete every portion that doesn't fit your needs.

## Project Setup with this Template and RStudio

1.  We create a project-specific repository and add you as a project member.

2.  Create folder where you want the project to live on your computer.

3.  Get the latest version of this template :

    -   Download a zip file of the template by clicking [![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheZetner/picturehosting/master/clone-or-download.png)](#) - includes git information, be sure to change to your own config

4.  Unzip to your project folder, update git information if appropriate (eg `rm .git*` will remove the git folder and ignore file)

5.  Load [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (are you not using RStudio? You really should be ;))

6.  Click *File\>New Project...\>Existing Directory*

7.  Select the unzipped template folder then *Create Project*

8.  Commit changes to the project-specific repository.

Start working! ‚å®Ô∏è

    +-- raw_data              <- Raw data goes here. Do not modify raw data in place. This isn't Excel.  
    \-- rmd                   <- R markdown documents
        +-- 01_read.Rmd       <- Set up script to read in raw data and do basic cleaning   
        +-- 02_analysis.Rmd   <- main analysis, advanced cleaning, data modeling and polishing charts 
        +-- 03_final.Rmd      <- final file with polished graphs and results description for client 
        \-- render_upload.R   <- uploading final HTML file to website 
    \-- scripts               <- scripts folder for everything else. 
        +-- render_upload.R   <- uploading final HTML file to website
    +-- doc                   <- intermediarie files (pdfs, docx)     
    +-- study_name.Rproj
    +-- README.md             <- This file. Replace it with an explanation of your project
    +--.gitgnore              <- Tells Git which files it shouldn't monitor. Please adjust. 

Note: `02_analysis.Rmd` and `03_final.Rmd` contain code snippets. See below for an explanation.

Note 2: More information in the respective `README.md` folder files.

## 3 Data Analysis Process

At first, following through the specifications may seem a lot but it helps to keep things organized and at the same time reduces the amount of emails/phone calls. Once you got a hang of it, it should be easy to get started.

Let¬¥s dive in! ü§ø

#### `02_analysis.Rmd`

This is were the data analysis magic is going on. This file is for internal use only and will not be shown to the client. Data visualizations should be finalized in this file. For our data analysis, we follow the [KISS principle](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/kiss-keep-it-simple-stupid-a-design-principle) - Keep it simple and stupid. That means that we want to start out our EDA as simple as possible and then, if needed, iteratively add more stuff (modeling, fancy visualizations etc). There have been too many times where we did nice visualizations without ever being used by the client. That¬¥s wasted life time.

As mentioned above, before we get started, we discuss what research questions may make sense or would be cool to look at.

**Always keep our mission in mind: We help companies come up with interesting topics, analyze and visualize their data, and turn the insights into great content that spreads.**

We envision the process as follows:

1.  Start with a simple analysis and a few selected variables (see David Robison¬¥s youtube channel for some inspiration: <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiiqmVK07qhY-wvg3IZiZQ>.\

    You circle back to us. If looks good, keep going. If not, "looks cool but may make sense to look at x instead of y". Or we discuss further what might be worth exploring.

2.  Do some more advanced stuff (e.g. modeling) if needed and appropriate for the task at hand.

3.  Rinse and repeat

**Important note:** You may want to create nice looking data visualizations if they serve the purpose but please do not tweak details like coloring, wording, etc. yet. This should be done once the client approved the plots and the findings. KISS! üíã

Some technical notes:

-   Every ggplot should be saved into pngs under the `plots/` folder. To do that, we want to generate first the pdfs that will be then generated into pngs. Code snippets are added for that purpose.

-   Please do not include ggplot in your functions. Yes, it¬¥s less code but harder to polish and adjust if needed.

-   When doing the EDA, please provide some key summary stats for the variable of interest. This can be showcased with a summary function or custom coded table (see example in rmd file).

-   Plot titles: Please use some basic descriptive title to make your point. However, do not spend too much time on it. Our business writer will replaces those with his own.

-   Basic theme and color code settings have been added. Please adjust according to the client¬¥s brand profile. Should be polished and worked on at the end of the project. Again, KISS! üíã

-   Please provide meaningful commit messages.

-   We¬¥ll send you a seperate .zip file with the data files if the size exceeds github¬¥s 100mb limit. Please remind us to send you the files.

#### `03_final.Rmd`

This will be the client facing data report. We like to keep the analysis seperated from the main findings document/report.

Generally, we like to structure the final report loosely to academic papers. That way, interested readers can always fall back to the html output if they want to read more about the methodology or look up detailed findings. It also keeps the analysis organized. However, please feel free to apply below structure to your `02_analysis.rmd` so we can simply copy-paste your findings to the `03_final.Rmd` file. Whatever works best in your work flow.

Report Structure is usually as follows:

1.  Introduction (Daniel takes care of that most of the time)
2.  Methodology
3.  Research findings
4.  Annex (more info can be found in the rmd file) (optional)

We usually add some some basic written description of the findings. If the plot is self-explanatory, there is most likely no need for it. However, if the findings are more technical and need explanation, always provide some bulleted short key takeaways. Below for a simple building structure of a example:

**1. Research finding X**

*here description finding 1*

*here description finding n*

*here key summary stats of variable of interest*

*here plot 1*

*here plot n*

**2. Research finding Y**

**etc.**

Some notes:

-   Get to the point when describing the results. You may interpret results to add some context to the findings. But don¬¥t add unnecessary fluff.

-   We use the `knitr::include_graphics` function to reference plots from the `plots/` folder. Code provided.

-   Please use a coherent title numbering e.g. 2.1 , 2.2., etc.

-   If you have some questions about a variable, unsure on how to proceed or something else that needs attention, just leave a comment like so in the rmd doc with your first initial e.g. `!!!D: I need your input here!`

#### Examples

See here for some data reports and the resulting final blog posts that were created for a client in the past:

1.  Data report: <https://frontpagedata.com/projects/backlinko/keyword-analytics/Final_Analysis.html>; Final blog post: <https://backlinko.com/keyword-research-tool-analysis>

2.  Data report: <https://frontpagedata.com/projects/backlinko/user-research/final.html>; Final blog post: <https://backlinko.com/google-user-behavior>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4 Review process 

You are expected to participate in the review process which may continue for several days after you've submitted the data report draft. This may include answering questions left in the Google Doc by customers.

-   Be as specific as possible when answering customers.

-   Respond in a timely and friendly manner.

We then hand this off to our business writer, or the client¬¥s in-house writer. During the writing process, you are expected to provide assistance if questions with regards to data points or findings arise.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5 Communication

Communication is very important to us during the data analysis process.

**Please provide status updates every 3 days**

-   Help the team to estimate how we're doing on time.

-   This removes unnecessary stress and pressure, especially if there's a slow-down.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Sending a simple one-liner will suffice.

    -   For example, "Making progress on Section X" or "Received your specification, will be able to look at them on Monday."

To share longer commentary, record a [Loom](https://loom.com/) video. To get clarity, hope on a Zoom/Skype call (see below for contact details).

## Questions/Suggestions?

If you have any questions about the process or anything else, please let me know.

Also, if you think there are better ways to structure/organize the template/reports, I more than happy to implement your changes to allow for a smoother work flow experience.

Excited to be working with you! üöÄ
