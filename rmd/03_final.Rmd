# 1 Introduction 


<br>
<br>

# 2 Methodology


<br>

#### Data preparation

Searches with volume 0 are removed from the data set. For *ahref* analysis, only searches with volume > 100 are looked at. Analyses are based on US location.

<br>
<br>

##### Data enrichment

~2.5 million searches were enriched with *ahref*. This includes the statistics difficulty, return rate, clicks, region volume, and SERP features.

<br>
<br>


#### Overview of the data

```{r}
tbl <- tribble(~Statistic, ~Value,
  "Total number of searches", "~306 million",
  "Total volume of searches", "~303 billion",
  "Searches with missing volume", "0.51%",
  "Mean search volume", "989",
  "Median search volume", "10",
  "Mean CPC", "0.61")

knitr::kable(tbl, caption = "Overview")
```

<br>
<br>

# 3 Research Findings 

<br>

## 3.1 Questions in searches

~14% of searches are in the form of a question. "how" is the most common question word.

```{r questions_count, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "questions_count-1.png"))
```

!!!D: please include the question by volume plot

<br>
<br>

## 3.2 Stopwords

"how" and "the" are the most common stopwords, which are present in 6-8% of searches.

```{r stopwords_count, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "stopwords_wordcloud-1.png"))
```

<br>
<br>

## 3.3. Keyword length

The most searched queries have length 6-9 characters, and falls continuously for search queries longer or shorter than that.

```{r keyword_length, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "keyword_length_volume-1.png"))
```

<br>
<br>

## 3.4 Keyword info categories

Internet & Telecom is the keyword category with the highest mean volume.

```{r search_category_mean_volume, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "search_category_volume_mean-1.png"))
```

Arts & Entertainment, Internet & Telecom, and News, Media & Publications have the highest total volume.

```{r search_category_total_volume, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "search_category_total_volume-1.png"))
```

Finance has the highest mean cost per click.

```{r search_category_cpc, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "search_category_cpc_mean-1.png"))
```

<br>
<br>

## 3.5 Keyword difficulty


!!!D: read your comments. LetÂ´s got with the violin plots here. 

As volume increases, the difficulty increases.

```{r difficulty_volume_sample, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "difficulty_volume_sample-1.png"))
```

From linear regression we find that for each doubling of the volume, the difficulty increases by 1.63. !!!D: Please provide a simple example. 

<br>

Difficulty and CPC are also correlated:

```{r difficulty_cpc_scatter, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "difficulty_cpc_scatter-1.png"))
```

!!!D: please add a correlation coefficient here as well. 

<br>
<br>

## 3.6 Spell types

Most of the searches with the highest volumes are attempts to go to a popular website.

```{r top_missspell, echo=FALSE}
title_description_table <- read.csv(here::here("plots", "csv", "top_misspell.csv"), stringsAsFactors=F)
knitr::kable(title_description_table, caption = "Searches with highest volume")
```

<br>

As a result about half of all volume has a spell type. Although only ~1.4% of searches have a spell type.


```{r misspell, echo=FALSE}
title_description_table <- read.csv(here::here("plots", "csv", "misspell.csv"), stringsAsFactors=F) %>% 
  mutate(site = spell)
knitr::kable(title_description_table, caption = "Top 10 intended searches that are misspelled")
```

<br>
<br>

## 3.7 Search volume

The top 2000 searches have extremely high volume, while the vast majority of the rest of the searches are very low volume.

```{r search_tails, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "search_tails-1.png"))
```

```{r search_tails2, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "search_tails2-1.png"))
```

Note that many of these extremely high volume searches are not a search for something as such, but an attempt to go to one of the popular sites above.

<br>
<br>


## 3.8 SERP features

(Note there are (at least) two additional SERP feature types (*Knowledge Panel* and *Videos*), for which the sample size is too small to include.)

The SERP features featured in the most searches are *Image pack* and *People also ask*:

```{r serp_presence_repr, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "serp_presence_repr-1.png"))
```

The knowledge card has a huge effect in reducing the clicks-per-search, while the other SERP features have limited effect. Searches with the Shopping results SERP feature have higher cps on average.

```{r serp_cps, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "serp_cps-1.png"))
```

Easy keywords have fewer SERP features.

```{r serp_difficulty_boxplot, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "serp_difficulty_boxplot-1.png"))
```

Thumbnail & Top stories is the most common SERP feature pairing.

```{r serp_pairs, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "serp_pairs-1.png"))
```

Searches without SERP features tend to be low volume.

```{r serp_volume_ridge, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "serp_volume_ridge-1.png"))
```

Searches with more SERP features have higher mean difficulty.

```{r serp_difficulty_n, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "serp_difficulty_n-1.png"))
```


<br>
<br>

## 3.9 Return rate

We can see that searches with high return rates tend to have lower difficulty, and to be clicked on a lot more.

```{r return_rate, echo=FALSE}
title_description_table <- read.csv(here::here("plots", "csv", "return_rate.csv"), stringsAsFactors=F)
knitr::kable(title_description_table, caption = "Comparison of searches with same volume but different return rates")
```

<br>
<br>


## 3.10 International searches

International searches have overall higher volume

```{r}
tribble(~region, ~volume,
        "US", "33%",
        "International", "67%")
```

[Note, this doesn't concur with the volume in the main data set. Not sure what is going on here.]


Internationally there are more searches with very low volume, while US has more searches with medium volume.

```{r comparison_count, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "comparison_count-1.png"))
```

There is not a large difference in the number of searches with very high volume. However, the total volume of these searches is a lot higher internationally

```{r comparison_volume, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "comparison_volume-1.png"))
```

Searches that have high US volume tend to have high international volume, and vice versa. But there are some exceptions.

```{r international_v_us_volume, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "international_v_us_volume-1.png"))
```

```{r tbl_int, echo=FALSE}
title_description_table <- read.csv(here::here("plots", "csv", "table_int.csv"), stringsAsFactors=F)
knitr::kable(title_description_table, caption = "Searches that have much higher volume internationally")
```

```{r tbl_us, echo=FALSE}
title_description_table <- read.csv(here::here("plots", "csv", "table_us.csv"), stringsAsFactors=F)
knitr::kable(title_description_table, caption = "Searches that have much higher volume in the US")
```



Searches that have higher volume in US have a higher click-per-search on average than searches that have higher volume internationally.

```{r international_cps, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "international_cps-1.png"))
```

They also have a higher cost-per-click on average

```{r international_cpc, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "international_cpc-1.png"))
```


Searches that have higher volume internationally, tend to have higher difficulty

```{r international_difficulty, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "international_difficulty-1.png"))
```
