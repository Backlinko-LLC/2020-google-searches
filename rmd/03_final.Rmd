# 2 Methodology
partly filled out by Daniel;

<br>

#### Data preparation

Searches with volume 0 are removed from the data set. For AHREF analysis, only searches with volume > 100 are looked at. Analyses are based on US location.

<br>
<br>

##### Data enrichment

~2.5 million searches were enriched with AHREF. This includes the statistics difficulty, return rate, clicks, click per search (cps), region volume, and SERP features.

<br>
<br>


#### Overview of the data

```{r}
tbl <- tribble(~Statistic, ~Value,
  "Total number of searches", "~306 million",
  "Total volume of searches", "~303 billion",
  "Searches with missing volume", "0.51%",
  "Mean search volume", "989",
  "Median search volume", "10",
  "Mean CPC", "0.61")

knitr::kable(tbl, caption = "Overview")
```

# 3 Research Findings 

<br>

## Questions in searches

~14% of searches are in the form of a question. "how" is the most common question word

```{r questions_count, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "questions_count-1.png"))
```

<br>
<br>

## Stopwords

"how" and "the" are the most common stopwords, which are present in 6-8% of searches.

```{r stopwords_count, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "stopwords_wordcloud-1.png"))
```

<br>
<br>

## Keyword length

The most searched queries have length 6-9 characters, and falls continuously for search queries longer or shorter than that.

```{r keyword_length, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "keyword_length_volume-1.png"))
```

<br>
<br>

## Keyword info categories

Internet & Telecom is the keyword category with the highest mean volume

```{r search_category_mean_volume, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "search_category_volume_mean-1.png"))
```

Arts & Entertainment, Internet & Telecom, and News, Media & Publications have the highest total volume

```{r search_category_total_volume, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "search_category_total_volume-1.png"))
```

Finance has the highest mean cost per click

```{r search_category_cpc, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "search_category_cpc_mean-1.png"))
```

<br>
<br>

## Keyword difficulty

As volume increases, the difficulty increases.

```{r difficulty_volume_sample, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "difficulty_volume_sample-1.png"))
```

From linear regression we find that for each doubling of the volume, the difficulty increases by 1.63

<br>

Difficulty and CPC are also correlated:

```{r difficulty_cpc_scatter, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "difficulty_cpc_scatter-1.png"))
```

<br>
<br>

## spell types

Most of the searches with the highest volumes are attempts to go to a popular website.

```{r top_missspell, echo=FALSE}
title_description_table <- read.csv(here::here("plots", "csv", "top_misspell.csv"), stringsAsFactors=F)
knitr::kable(title_description_table, caption = "Searches with highest volume")
```

<br>

As a result about half of all volume has a spell type. Although only ~1.4% of searches have a spell type.


The most popular websites that are redirected from misspelling:

```{r misspell, echo=FALSE}
title_description_table <- read.csv(here::here("plots", "csv", "misspell.csv"), stringsAsFactors=F)
knitr::kable(title_description_table, caption = "Top 10 intended searches that are misspelled")
```

<br>
<br>

## Search volume

The top 2000 searches have extremely high volume, while the vast majority of the rest of the searches is very low volume.

```{r search_tails, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "search_tails-1.png"))
```

```{r search_tails2, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "search_tails2-1.png"))
```

Note that many of these extremely high volume searches are not a search for something as such, but an attempt to go to one of the popular sites above.

<br>
<br>


## SERP features

(Note there are (at least) two additional SERP feature types (*Knowledge Panel* and *Videos*), for which the sample size is too small to include.)

The SERP features featured in the most searches are *Image pack* and *People also ask*:

```{r serp_presence_repr, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "serp_presence_repr-1.png"))
```

The knowledge card has a huge effect in reducing the clicks-per-search, while the other SERP features have limited effect. Searches with the Shopping results SERP feature have higher cps on average.

```{r serp_cps, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "serp_cps-1.png"))
```

Low difficulty keywords have fewer SERP features

```{r serp_difficulty_boxplot, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "serp_difficulty_boxplot-1.png"))
```

Thumbnail & Top stories is the most common SERP feature pairing

```{r serp_pairs, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "serp_pairs-1.png"))
```

Searches without SERP features tend to be low volume

```{r serp_volume, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "serp_volume-1.png"))
```

<br>
<br>

## Return rate

We can see that searches with high return rates tend to have lower difficulty, and to be clicked on a lot more.

```{r return_rate, echo=FALSE}
title_description_table <- read.csv(here::here("plots", "csv", "return_rate.csv"), stringsAsFactors=F)
knitr::kable(title_description_table, caption = "Comparison of searches with same volume but different return rates")
```
